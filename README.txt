Secure Password Generator
------------------------

This is my Python script to generate secure passwords. 
I built it to create random passwords with a custom length, making sure they have at least one letter, number, and special character.

Features:
- Lets you choose the password length (minimum 8 characters).
- Uses letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), and special characters.

How to Use:
1. Save the file as password_generator.py.
2. Run it with Python: python password_generator.py
3. Enter the length you want when asked.

Example:
- Input: 10
- Output: Your password: k7@nPx#jLm
